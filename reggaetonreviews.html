            Reggaeton Reviews
            <div class="description"><br />I will be reviewing different Reggaeton songs on how they make me feel, how catchy they are, how easy it is to learn the lyrics and also how socially acceptable they are. Also I define Reggaeton as any banger in spanish that I have heard.</div>

                <div class ="description"><br/>The opening of the video is the latino guy from that 70s show saying that for every beautiful woman in the world there is a man sick of being with her. He then puts on his wedding ring. Welcome to reggaeton.<br/><br/> The first bit of music you hear is "Maluma baby". This is a song by Maluma and he knows he has to draw you in with something, so what better than his own name followed by baby. The music starts though and what a banger. I spent years of my life thinking that the only type of music worth listening to was whiny white boys singing about their feelings off key into a guitar but lo fi a la bright eyes or okkervil river, but I was wrong. The music starts and I realise that real music is colombian men singing about girls while over produced computer generated beats play over the top.<br/><br/> Maluma sings and a woman in underwear that I am going to describe as very adult with lots of tushy walks in the background. The scene then changes to the same woman but clothed sitting at the bar that the previously mentioned latino from that 70s show was sitting at. I don´t want to get too "pulp fiction/memento" but it seems as if this video is not being shown in chronological order.<br/><br/> He leans into her and she is wearing a dress that I am going to describe as very adult with lots of breast and starts with the banger part: <br/><br/>Spanish<br/>           
                    <i>Si conmigo te quedas<br/>O con otro tú te vas<br/>No me importa un carajo<br/>Porque sé que volverás (x2)<br/><br/>Y si con otro pasas el rato<br/>Vamos a ser feliz, vamos a ser feliz <br/>Felices los 4<br/>Te agrandamos el cuarto<br/><br/>Y si con otro pasas el rato<br/>Vamos a ser feliz, vamos a ser feliz<br/>Felices los 4<br/>Yo te acepto el trato</i><br/><br/>English<br/><i>If you stay with me<br/>Or leave with someone else<br/>I don´t give a shit<br/>Because I know you will return (x2)<br/><br/>If you spend time with someone else<br/>We are going to be happy, We are going to be happy<br/>Happy, the 4 of us<br/>We will make the bedroom bigger the 4 of us </i>(this line doesn´t translate as well into spanish)<i><br/><br/>If you spend time with someone else<br/>We are going to be happy, We are going to be happy<br/>Happy, the 4 of us<br/>I accept the agreement</i><br/><br/>
                At this stage everyone with the ability to hear and feel has been sucked in and there isn´t really much more to do except marvel at the wonder of colombian music. As far as Reggaeton songs go, this is about as ´woke´ as you get. Maluma isn´t exerting ownership over the woman and is happily willing to participate in a polyamorous relationship. <br/><br/>The film clip features more kissing, dancing, more dresses, different suits for Maluma, a sort of rap which features the words boom boom, and a 4some dance between latino that 70s guy, the previously featured woman and Maluma. <br/><br/>It´s pretty light on storyline for my liking as I am a big fan of music videos with a story as it´s like getting a bonus. Needless to say though the music is as close to perfection as you can get. It´s a stone cold banger to anyone with the ability to experience the human connection.<br/><br/>For those that like a bit of a mind fuck the clip ends with that 70s guy returning to the bar and telling Maluma "I see you have already met the most beautiful girl" and puts his arm around the woman we have previously seen in a post coitus getting dressed ritual with Maluma. Maluma responds by saying in english "I had the pleasure of meeting her" in a way that leaves very little doubt that Maluma will not be able to pursue an acting career and makes it clear to latino that 70s guy that he has had sexual intercouse with her.<br/><br/>Latino that 70s guy looks up and then at his girl and then it all washes over him and he smirks. He doesn´t care. He is on board with the polyamorous lifestyle that Maluma has been singing about for the last 4 minutes.  (For bonus points the salsa version makes it even more obvious that everyone is participating in some sort of menage a 4 colombian style.)<br/><br/>It´s an absolute banger from start to finish. It makes me feel alive. I like to sing the song to my girlfriend but pretend that the 4 that are happy are me and different parts of her body. She is not as big a fan as I am but she is still a pretty big fan.
